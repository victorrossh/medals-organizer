# Medals Organizer

A simple Python script to update categories in a `medals.ini` file, transforming category 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and 11 to 12, and saving the result as `medals_organizado.ini`.

## Purpose
This script reads a `medals.ini` file and updates specific category numbers while preserving the file structure.

## Usage
1. Place your `medals.ini` file in the same directory as the script (or update the path in the script).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. Check the output file `medals_organizado.ini` in the same directory.
